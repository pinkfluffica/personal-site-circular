    <h1>Things I learned</h1>
    <p>Vertical align can accept numerical values, not just words! I used this for the page numbers. I used some box shadows for the cards. I wrote my own responsive grid for positioning the cards. I used transform: rotate() to make the cards seem tilted. Transform rotate can be used on any element, including the "body" tag, which seems like a great opportunity for mischief. The transform command can make elements fall off the screen, causing a horizontal scrollbar. This can be fixed by adding padding to the body tag. I used an element and its pseudo-elements to create the four corner images in card 1, but I could have used multiple background images from CSS3. I looked up semantic HTML markup for poetry (there is no official sanction) to deal with the line breaks in card 2.</p>
